title: Writing Goals and Principles

With every piece of service we publish, we aim to:

* **Empower.** Help people understand about gov services by using language that informs them and make it easier to navigate through the service seamlessly.

* **Respect.** Treat users with the respect they deserve. Put yourself in their shoes, and don’t patronize them. Remember that they have other things to do. Be considerate and inclusive. Don’t market at people; communicate with them and help them find what they are looking for easily.

* **Educate.** Tell users what they need to know about every service. Give them the exact information they need, along with opportunities to learn more. Remember that you’re the expert, and readers don’t have access to everything you know.

* **Guide.** Think of yourself as a tour guide for our users. Whether you’re leading them through our educational materials or faqs or any given service, communicate in a friendly and helpful way.

In order to achieve those goals, we make sure our content is:

* **Clear.** Understand the service you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.

* **Useful.** Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?

* **Friendly.** Write like a human. Don’t be afraid to break a few rules if it makes your writing more relatable. All of our content, from splashy homepage copy to system alerts, should be warm and human.

* **Appropriate.** Write in a way that suits the situation. Just like you do in face-to-face conversations, adapt your tone depending on who you’re writing to and what you’re writing about.
